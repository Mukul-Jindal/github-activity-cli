# Github-Activity-CLI

Simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project helped practice my programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

Sample solution for the [github-user-activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).
